# Nvidia driver helper

A program to help you manage the driver of your Nvidia GPU. Features include
- Allow users to query the latest version of the GPU driver
- Download the installation file if an update is available

## Background
As we all know, Nvidia has its own driver utility called Geforce Experience. However, it requires an account even if you only want to do driver updates, which is ridiculous. What's more, it's not open-source. So, this software is written.

## Platform
- [x] Microsoft Windows 10+
- [ ] Linux

## Future Work
- Built-in downloader
- Installer
- Peroidic background query
- Automatic device mapping
- Something more...
